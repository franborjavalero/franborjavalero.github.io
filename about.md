Hello,

I am Francisco de Borja Valero (most people call me Fran), a MSc student in Artificial Intelligence at the Polytechnic University of Valencia.

I am broadly interested in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing.

Formerly, I worked at <a href="https://transducens.dlsi.ua.es/">Transducens Research Group</a> of the University of Alicante doing stuff related with Machine Translation and Machine Learning.

Thanks for stopping by.
