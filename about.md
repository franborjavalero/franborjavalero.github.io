Hello,

I am Francisco de Borja Valero (most people call me Fran), a research intern working on Podcast Topic Modeling at Deezer.

My interests are NLP, ML and Python.

Formerly, I worked on fine-tuning transformer models for Natural Language Understanding and Text Generation at Kustomer Inc. Before that, I worked at Transducens research group of the University of Alicante doing projects related to Machine Translation and Machine Learning.

Feel free to be in touch! Thanks for stopping by.
